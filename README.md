# Oil Futures and Storage Options - FIN-404 Derivatives Course Project (Spring 2024)

This repository contains the codes, report, and supporting documents for the Derivatives course project (FIN-404) at the College of Management of Technology. The project focuses on the analysis and valuation of oil futures and storage options.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to study the market for oil futures contracts and analyze the valuation of various contracts related to oil storage. The project is divided into three parts: documentation, analysis, and calibration/implementation.

### Part 1: Documentation

In this section, we provide a basic presentation of the market for crude oil futures using contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as a reference. This introductory briefing includes the following points:

- Description of oil futures contracts.
- Cash flows associated with a long position in a futures contract and rollover of long positions.
- Purpose and importance of oil futures for investors.
- Evolution of trading volume and open interest across maturities.
- Explanation of convenience yield and its impact on spot and futures prices.
- Analysis of market conditions like Backwardation and Contango.
- Overview of other types of oil derivatives traded on the CME.

### Part 2: Analysis

In this section, we model the spot price of oil using a stochastic process and derive various relationships and pricing formulas, including:

- Spot price modeling using the Gibson and Schwartz (1990) model.
- Equivalence to other models such as Gabillon (1991) and Schwartz and Smith (2000).
- Bond pricing and derivation of the zero-coupon bond price formula.
- Futures pricing under the given spot price model.
- Analysis of the importance of stochastic convenience yield and stochastic interest rates.

### Part 3: Calibration and Implementation

This section focuses on calibrating the model parameters using market data and implementing the valuation of storage options:

- Calibration of the risk-free rate and convenience yield parameters.
- Implementation of storage option valuation based on the calibrated model.
- Sensitivity analysis of the storage option price with respect to various parameters.
